# word-strata
Word Strata is a C# GUI word game, very much still in progress. It is not yet runnable but I've developed a good portion of the DLL with unit tests. Eventually, it will be a three dimensional word-finding game. Classes have been established for the board, letter tiles, etc. I developed a solver that checks to see if there are any words remaining on the board by using a recursive, breadth-first search algorithm. 

I created Word Strata in order to learn WPF/XAML and experiment with test-driven development.
