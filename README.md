# word-strata
Word Strata is a C# GUI word game, very much still in progress. Eventually, it will be a three dimensional word-finding game, but right now the board solver just works through unit tests. Classes have been established for the board, letter tiles, etc. The solver checks to see if there are any words remaining on the board by using a recursive, breadth-first search algorithm. 

I created Word Strata in order to learn WPF/XAML and experiment with test-driven development.
