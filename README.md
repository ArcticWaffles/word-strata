# Word Strata

Word Strata is a WPF word game in progress. Much of the basic structure has been established, and I wrote a solver that checks to see if there are any words remaining on the board by using a recursive, breadth-first search algorithm. 

I created Word Strata in order to learn WPF/XAML and general GUI concepts, such as animation, data binding, and MVVM. I've also used it to explore various testing frameworks and experiment with test-driven development.

Plans for the future:

* Multi-layered gameboard (3D)
* Attractive theme for each level
* Port to Xamarin for Android/iOS
